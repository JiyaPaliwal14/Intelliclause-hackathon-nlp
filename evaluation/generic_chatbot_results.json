A lawyer would need to determine if the buyer's right to cancel after 10 weeks of delay constitutes a form of termination for convenience.\n* **Clause 17. Force Majeure:** This clause allows for contract termination if a force majeure event lasts for more than 10 weeks. A lawyer would need to analyze if this clause could be interpreted more broadly to allow for termination by either party under certain circumstances.\n* **General Principles:**  A lawyer should also review the general principles outlined in Clause 1.2, which states that the order prevails over the agreement. This could potentially allow for unilateral termination by the buyer if the order is modified or canceled.\n\n**Overall:** While the contract doesn't explicitly address termination for convenience, a lawyer should carefully review the clauses mentioned above to determine the extent to which a party can unilaterally terminate the agreement.",

      "predicted_answer": "Yes, there are insurance requirements in this contract. \n\nHere's the relevant section:\n\n**10. INSURANCE:** To be covered by the Seller for 110% invoice value against All Risks and War Risk. \n\n**Key Points for a Lawyer to Review:**\n\n* **Coverage:**  \"All Risks and War Risk\" is a broad coverage type. A lawyer should confirm this is sufficient for the specific goods and potential risks involved in the shipment.\n* **110% Invoice Value:**  This is a high coverage amount. A lawyer should assess if this is standard practice and if it aligns with industry norms or the buyer's risk tolerance.\n* **Seller's Responsibility:** The contract clearly states the seller is responsible for obtaining this insurance. A lawyer should review the contract to ensure the seller has the necessary mechanisms to ensure the insurance is in place and maintained throughout the contract term.\n* **Certificate of Insurance:** The contract doesn't explicitly mention requiring the seller to provide a certificate of insurance to the buyer. A lawyer should consider adding this clause to ensure the buyer has proof of coverage.\n* **Claims Process:** The contract should outline the process for filing insurance claims in case of damage or loss. A lawyer should review this to ensure it is clear, fair, and protects the buyer's interests. \n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.",
